This script allows players to convert their items into vehicles, enabling them to spawn vehicles directly from specific items. Once spawned, vehicles can be stored back, and the original item will be returned to the player. The script supports both QB and ESX frameworks, making it compatible with popular FiveM setups.

Key features include:

* **Vehicle Ownership**: Only the vehicle's owner can store it, preventing unauthorized access. This feature supports safe trading and selling of vehicles without risk of theft.
* **Customization Options**: Vehicles can be spawned in their default state or fully tuned, depending on your preference.
* **Configurable Settings**: Additional settings can be customized via the configuration file, offering flexibility to tailor the script to your server's needs.

The script is user-friendly and easy to install, ensuring a smooth integration into your existing server.
